1. Installed  Node Version Manager NVM via Homebrew


2.  I start with  ' source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh '  on command line 
    after reviewing some error codes on compatibilty and
    dependencies issues this worked for me, 

3. Using Node 14  & webpack 4

on cli 
1. source $(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh
2. npm run-build-prod  
3. npm run build-dev
4. npm run start
